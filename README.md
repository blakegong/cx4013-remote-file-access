## UDP Reliable Connection Design
Implement [stop-and-wait ARQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-and-wait_ARQ) from [sliding window Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window_protocol) on top of UDP

## Request/Reply Message Design
In this layer, we will handle function call and data transfer protocol. The details of the 65507 bytes in Data section of UDP Packet are to be discussed.
